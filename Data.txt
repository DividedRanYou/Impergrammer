Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes is a 2012 Lego-themed action-adventure game developed by Traveller's Tales and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The game is a sequel to Lego Batman: The Videogame[2] and the second installment in the Lego Batman series. The game's main storyline follows Batman, Robin and later Superman as they attempt to foil the Joker and Lex Luthor's plans to have the latter become president of the United States, joining forces with the Justice League along the way. As a result, the game's cast is larger than its predecessor and includes characters outside of the Batman series.

The game is presented in a third-person perspective, with missions in the game showing an emphasis on exploration. The player is able to complete various side missions within the fictional Gotham City to unlock characters and use them within missions once completed. The game is the first in Traveller's Tales' Lego series to feature spoken dialogue and an open world.

Lego Batman 2 was released worldwide for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Wii, Xbox 360, PlayStation Vita, Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo DS in June 2012. An OS X version of the game, published by Feral Interactive, was released in September 2012, followed by a Wii U version in May 2013.
